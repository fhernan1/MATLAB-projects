% 3.17	Write a script called multiples that processes an array (of any dimensionality) 
% called numbers and a number called divisor, and creates a vector called multiplesVec 
% that contains only those elements of numbers that are multiples of divisor. If there 
% aren’t any elements in the array numbers or the resulting vector, your
% script should produce an empty vector.
% Note: You can use the MATLAB function rem(x,y) to check if the remainder
% of dividing x by y is equal to zero. 
% Hint: You shouldn’t need iteration to solve this problem.
