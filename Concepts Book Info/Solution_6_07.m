% 6-7	Write a function called tripFlip that takes in one string and
% switches each even-indexed character with the odd-indexed character
% immediately preceding it. 
% You must use iteration to complete this problem.

% Examples:
tripFlip('orange') % -> ‘ronaeg’
tripFlip('Matlab is cool') % -> ‘aMltbai  soclo’ 
% Assume that the string length is always greater than one.
% Note: Spaces count as characters as well. If the string has an
% odd-numbered length, then the function ignores the last letter.
