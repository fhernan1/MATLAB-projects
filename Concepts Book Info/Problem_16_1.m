% 16.5	Adapt the quick sort in place algorithm to operate on a cell array of strings sorting the strings alphabetically ignoring case. You will need to adapt the generic comparison functions to include comparing alphabetically.
% 16.6	Adapt the bubble sort algorithm to operate on a structure array, one of whose fields is called “name.” Sort the structures alphabetically by the name field ignoring case. You could use the generic comparison functions previously adapted to include comparing alphabetically.
% 16.7	Write a script that will take a structure array and sort it using the internal MATLAB sort(…) algorithm. It should request the name of a field in the structure array containing numerical data, and sort the array based on the contents of that field. You could use the CD collection from Chapter 10 and sort it on the value or stars fields, for example.
