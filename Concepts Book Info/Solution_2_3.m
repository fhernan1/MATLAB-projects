% 2.3 After a very hard week at work, Kirk is driving to Helen, Georgia for
% a tubing trip (to cool off). He drives 200 miles north from his home to
% Timbuktu. He then turns right and travels 400 miles east to Helen. Write
% a script to compute the linear distance, d, from his home to Helen.
north = 200;
east = 400;
d = sqrt(north^2 + east^2)
