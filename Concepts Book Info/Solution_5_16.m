% 5-16	Coming off a respectable 7–6 record last year, the Georgia Tech
% football team is looking to improve on that this season. They want you to
% write a function called teamRecord that takes in two parameters: wins and
% losses, and returns two values: season, and wPercentage.
% wins = numbers of wins for the season
% losses = number of losses for the season
% season = 1 for a winning season, that is, there are more wins than losses
%        = 0 otherwise
% wPercentage = the percentage of games won (ranging from 0 to 100)
