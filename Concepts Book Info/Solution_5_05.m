% 5.5	Your uncle Rico insists that at one time he could throw a football
% a quarter mile (1 mile = 5,280 feet). Write a MATLAB function called
% howFast that consumes an angle in degrees and returns the velocity in
% meters per second (m/s) that uncle Rico would need to throw the ball a
% quarter mile.
% The distance that the ball travels is computed by the following formula:
%  d = (v^2/g)sin(2th)
% where v is the speed the ball is initially thrown,  th is the angle
% consumed by the function, and  is 9.8 m/s2. (1 m = 3.28 ft).
