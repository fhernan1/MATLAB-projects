% 9.5	Write a function called GCD to find the greatest common divisor of
% two numbers. You must use recursion and no iteration of any kind to solve
% this problem. Recall that the GCD of m and n is the largest integer that
% divides both m and n with no remainder. You may assume both m and n will
% be positive.
