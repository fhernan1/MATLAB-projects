% 14-6	You want to read in a sound myfile.wav and perform a Fast Fourier
% transform on it. Which of the following lines of code would accomplish
% this with no errors?
% a.	[a, b] = wavread('myfile.wav'); r = fft(a, b);
% b.	[c, d] = wavread('myfile.wav'); s = fft(d, c);
% c.	[e, f] = wavread('myfile.wav'); u = fft(e);  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
% d.	[g, h] = wavread('myfile.wav'); t = fft(h);
